# Music-Playlist-Manager

Description: The Music Playlist Manager is a Java console application designed to help users organize and interact with their music playlists efficiently using Java’s List collection. This project offers fundamental playlist management features, such as adding, removing, displaying, and rearranging songs. Users can also search for songs by title or artist, and additional options like shuffling, sorting, and saving/loading playlists from a file enhance functionality.

Key Features:

Add & Remove Songs: Users can add new songs (with details like title, artist, and duration) or remove songs by title or position.
Display Playlist: View all songs in the playlist, including each song’s title, artist, and duration.
Reorder Songs: Users can move songs within the playlist by position or reverse the entire list.
Shuffle Playlist: Randomly rearrange songs within the playlist for a fresh order.
Save & Load: Save the current playlist to a file or load a previously saved playlist to continue where they left off.
Search and Sort: Locate songs by title or artist and organize them alphabetically as needed.
Technologies Used:

Java Collections Framework: Utilizes Java's List collection for playlist management.
Java Swing (Optional): Basic GUI to improve user experience.
File Handling: Enables persistence by allowing users to save playlists to and load them from files.
This project demonstrates essential skills in using Java collections, basic file handling, and object-oriented programming, making it ideal for learning or extending into a more comprehensive music management application.
